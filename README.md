# COMP472-A2
project 2 

https://github.com/IzzoJer/COMP472-A2/

To run our program all you need to do is call main.py.

In the main, simply import whatever heuristic algorithm you want to use (ucs, gbfs, a_star) and either create the corresponding object with the head (puzzle, heuristic_number)
Where the heuristic number can be 0: for the demo heuristic. 1: for the sum of permutation inversions. 2: for the total manhattan distance.
